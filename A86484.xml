         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of Gathering Churches.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Aſſerted in my anſwer, <hi>That the Apoſtles never taught or practiſed to gather or ſeparate ſome Chriſtians from others, one part of this true Church, and another part of that, (eſpecially per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which themſelves converted not) to make a purer Church, neither with, nor without the Magiſtrates Authority.</hi> To this you Reply: <hi>The Apoſtles both taught and practiſed the ſeparating of ſome Jews from other Jews, and gathering them into a Chriſtian Church, while yet the Jewiſh Church was not diſſolved: for they ceaſed not to be a Church of God, till the body of them pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and deſperatly rejected Christ: Therefore they preached to the Jews firſt, and thought themſelves bound ſo to do, becauſe they were the people of God</hi> Acts 11.19. &amp; 13.46. <hi>And yet they had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome to ſeparate from the reſt (as your ſelf acknowledg)</hi> Acts 2.40. <hi>And their communion they had with them in Iewiſh worſhips, ſhews that they counted them a true Church. And ſome think that their Church ſtate ceaſed not while their Temple ſtood. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time many Iews were gathered into many Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as both the Acts of the Apoſtles, and their Epiſtles do declare. And if they might gather out of one Church, they might as lawfully have gathered out of twenty, or an hundred, had there been ſo many at that time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rejoynder</hi> 1. Suppoſe (at preſent) that the Jewiſh Church was then a true Church and not <hi>yet</hi> diſſolved, yet it was then <hi>in diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:114193:4"/>and ceaſing to be a true Church, your own words <hi>[Yet the Iewiſh Church was not diſſolved]</hi> do intimate ſo much, and the thing is undeniable, that Church was but to continue for a time, and then to be diſſolved by Gods appointment. As it was ſaid of the <hi>two covenants,</hi> that <hi>the firſt was taken away that the other might be eſtabliſhed,</hi> Heb. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. So it was with thoſe <hi>two Churches,</hi> that <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> this <hi>Evangelical;</hi> the firſt was taken away, that the other might be eſtabliſhed: and therefore ſeparation from the then Jewiſh Church was more warrantable, then from our Churches, unleſs you count them true Churches only in the ſenſe you ſpeak of, viz. the <hi>body of them have not pertinaciouſly and deſperatly rejected Chriſt</hi> come in the fleſh, and that (as the Jewiſh Church <hi>then</hi>) they <hi>now</hi> are to be diſſolved, yea that they are in diſſolving by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and ceaſing to be true Churches, notwithſtanding the progreſs that is made in Reformation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You do not reply directly and pertinently but obliquely and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadingly (though in your laſt book called the Congregational way juſtifyed P. 17. You are bold to ſay, that <hi>no reply can more front or diametrically oppoſe my Anſwer then yours doth</hi>) yea, I dare appeal to your ſelves whether a precept or preſident of gathering or ſeparating a Church out of the Churches of Galatia, Corinth, Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea, becauſe of their many and great corruptions would not have more fronted, and bin more point-blank oppoſite to that part of my (as your wiſdoms ſtile it) confuſed anſwer then this inſtance of the Jewiſh Church. For
<list>
                     <item>firſt, Did ever any man deny that there might then be ſeparation from the Jewiſh Church? Could you think I did deny it? Your ſelves cite me acknowledging it, and you could not but know after I had publiſhed my Epiſtle and Quere's (what ever you did before) that an inſtance of ſeparation from true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches, would moſt diametrically have oppoſed my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which ſpeaks not of ſeparation of Chriſtians from Jews (as your inſtance doth) but of ſome Chriſtians from others, and I dare witneſs thus much for you, that if you had ſuch a one, you would have preferred it before the other.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Whereas you ſay in your laſt P. 18. That <hi>you do not conſider that Church as Iewiſh, but under the notion of truth,</hi> you acknowledg that you do not conſider it as you ought to have conſidered it, for the ſeperation was from that Church as it was Jewiſh, having officers and ordinances diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Chriſtian Church, which hath <hi>Miniſters</hi> in ſtead of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114193:4"/>
                        <hi>Prieſts,</hi> which hath not bodily ſacrifices of beaſts, nor ſuch Sacraments and Ceremonial ſervices, nor the preſence of God in one place eſpecially, as the Jews had, and the lawfulneſs of ſeparation from that Church, (if it were then a true Church, and had not been Jewiſh) is ſtil uncleared.</item>
                     <item>3. The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches and Miniſters, are not to be compared to the then Jewiſh Church and the Prieſts thereof, as you ſeem to compare them by pleading, that the Reformed Churches, and Miniſters may be ſeparated from, becauſe the then Jewiſh Church and Preiſts were to be ſeparated from; nor is this concerning the <hi>Miniſters impertinently ſhuffled in</hi> (as in your laſt P. 18. You moſt untruly alledge) for they which ſeparate from a Church, do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the officers of it; they that ſeparated from the Jewiſh Church did withdraw from the obedience of their Prieſts, and they that ſeparate from the Reformed Churches, do withdraw from the obedience of their Miniſters, and withdrawing (your ſelves tell us, Pag. 60.) is a negative Excommunication, and therefore the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have as much or more injury, then ſo many members have in every unjuſt ſeparation from them, as your ſelves would ſay, were it your caſe; but this muſt ſerve in ſtead of a better reply. Surely you have either too much charity to the then Jewiſh Church and Preiſts thereof, or too litle to our Churches and Miniſters.</item>
                     <item>4. That Church was but one, and you ſhould ſhew gathering out of ſeveral Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, for whereas you alledge <hi>they might have gathered out of twenty, or an hundred, had there been ſo many at that time.</hi> I anſwer, that it may be there were twenty, poſſibly an hundred Churches while the Jewiſh Temple ſtood: your ſelves ſay <hi>there were many Chriſtian Churches,</hi> and yet I doubt not but you will acknowledg both, that no Churches were gathered or ſeparated out of thoſe or any other true Chriſtian Churches, and alſo that it is more lawful and orderly to ſeparate the pretious of one Chriſtian Church from the vile there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the Godly party to caſt out the incurable ſinfull party 1 Cor. 5.12. Then to ſeparate ſome perſons of ſeverall Churches into one diſtinct Church, the former being not a gathering of a Church but a reforming and purging of it, which is warranted by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas you ſpeak much both in your former and latter Book, of the truth of the then Jewiſh Church, I pray you what trueneſs mean you? A <hi>naturall trueneſs,</hi> as a thief or a lyar is a true man, <hi>(id eſt)</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:114193:5"/>truly a man, and Sathan a true ſpirit that is truly a ſpirit, or a <hi>morall trueneſs,</hi> viz. that it held and taught the way of ſalvation, dare you ſay that the Jewiſh Church then did hold and teach the way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Did they not pertinaciouſly and deſperatly reject Chriſt? No not while their Temple ſtood, as you ſay, ſome think? The Scripture calls them an <hi>untoward generation,</hi> from which it exhorts <hi>tho e that were pricked in their hearts,</hi> (which were but few in reſpect of the body of the Jews) <hi>to ſave themſelvs,</hi> and from amongſt which the Lord converted and <hi>added to the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Church, ſuch as ſhould be ſaved,</hi> Acts 2.40.47. And <hi>they did put the word from them being filled withenty, contradicting and blaſpheming,</hi> Acts 13.45.46. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Apoſtle. Rom. 11.11, 12, 15, 19. Plainly implyeth, that the Jewiſh Church ceaſed to be a true Church, did <hi>fall,</hi> was <hi>broken off, caſt away,</hi> before ſalvation came to the Gentiles. Nor do your Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or reaſons ſolidly prove that the Jewiſh Church was then a true Church; for one of your texts, Acts 11. which you produce for that purpoſe ſaith, That they that were ſcattered (whom in this place you call Apoſtles contrary to Scripture, Acts 8.1. and your own aſſertion elſewhere; <hi>Defence,</hi> P. 4.) Preached ſome to the Jews only, and ſome when they were come to <hi>Antioch,</hi> to the <hi>Grecians</hi> alſo, Acts 11.20. Now the <hi>Grecians</hi> were not then a Church of God, nor ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered (yourſelvs ſay) into Church ſtate til <hi>Barnabas</hi> was ſent to them, <hi>Defence</hi> p. 4. The other text mentions their Preaching to the Jews firſt, but that <hi>they thought themſelves bound to Preach to the Iews firſt, becauſe they were the people of God,</hi> is your gloſs, which cannot be inferred from your texts joyntly or ſeverally; you know Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand might make it neceſſary, they ſhould Preach to the Jews firſt, whether they were at that very time the people of God or no, and that was the true reaſon of it, as you may ſee by comparing Acts 13.46.47. with, Math. 10.1.5.6. But neither their Preaching firſt to the Jews nor afterwards to the Gentiles, doth evince that either of them were then the people of God. As for the Communion the Apoſtles had with the Jews which is your ſecond argument, to prove the true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the then Jewiſh Church, I would you had expreſſed what <hi>Communion</hi> what <hi>worſhips</hi> you mean, if that which you count pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Church-Communion, then the Apoſtles did not (as you ſay they did) teach and practiſe ſeperation from the then Jewiſh Church, at leaſt not a totall one, they had yet <hi>Church Communion</hi> with her, if you mean not Church Communion which is properly and peculiarly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114193:5"/>ſuch, then it did not ſhew that they counted her a true Church: Though the Apoſtles being Jews and formerly members of that Church might become <hi>Iews to the Iews,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.20. That <hi>they might ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the Iews</hi> and <hi>give no offence,</hi> Acts 21. (which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to do to thoſe that are within or without the Church, 1 Cor. 10.32.) Might give great reſpect to the Jewiſh Church and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips even after they were then dead, as in ſome places by way of funeral pomp, the honour done to great perſonages by their attendants while they lived is in meaſure continued to them after their death, till they be buried, as uncovering the head, carrying maces and ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before them, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Vnleſs you can ſolidly prove
<list>
                     <item>1. That the Jewiſh Church was then a true Church by a morall trueneſs.</item>
                     <item>2 That there is or ought to be ſuch a change of our Miniſtry, Sacraments, and ſervice of God in the Churches gathered from amongſt us, as was then of the Jewiſh Prieſthood, Sacraments, and ſervice of God, in thoſe Churches which were gathered from amongſt them.</item>
                     <item>3 That the Reformed Churches and Miniſters, may as lawfully be forſaken as the then Jewiſh Church and the Prieſts thereof.</item>
                     <item>4 That you have authority to gather Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches amongſt us, as wel as the Apoſtles had for gathering Churches from amongſt the Jews.</item>
                     <item>5 That men are bound to become Independents when they hear you preach, as the Jews were to become Chriſtians when they heard the voyce of the great Prophet, Deut. 18.18, 19. Vnleſs alſo you can invalidate my other fore-mentioned <hi>exceptions</hi> againſt this inſtance I would adviſe you to lay it aſide and to paſs to another argument.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Sect. 2. Reply, P. 2. <hi>Secondly, if the Apoſtles never taught nor practiſed ſuch a thing, what warrant then have our brethren for their Presbyterian Church, which is gathered out of many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? For they interpret, Mat.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Tell the Church, of a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Church, which conſiſts of the Elders of many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rejoynder. What do you hence conclude that <hi>the Apoſtles taught and practiſed to gather ſome Chriſtians from others, one part of this true Church,</hi> &amp;c? This is it which P. 18. of your laſt Book you profeſs to ſhew at large in this and the ſubſequent particulars, then belike you acknowledg that the gathering of Presbyterian Churches is according to the doctrin and practiſe of the Apoſtles. 2 Between a Presbyterian Church and your gathered and ſeperated Church
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114193:6"/>there is moſt difference. For,
<list>
                     <item>1 A Presbyterian Church is not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregation, nor are al her members accounted to be members of a particular congregation, much leſs covenanted members ſuch as yours are.</item>
                     <item>2 She doth not refuſe the communió of thoſe congregations, out of which you ſay it is gathered, and therefore cannot be called <hi>a ſeperated</hi> Church.</item>
                     <item>3. She is gathered with the conſent of her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.</item>
                     <item>4 She doth not caſt off the care of government of thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, but her gathering makes much for the better government of them, and for ſetling of truth and peace in them, as the convening in Parliament of the principall patriots, out of ſeverall Counties doth make for the good government of the State.</item>
                     <item>Laſtly, their gathering is warranted (as hereafter <hi>Poſ.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. may appear) by the Doctrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and practice of the Apoſtles which you cannot ſhew of yours. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim you may take notice that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton</hi> himſelf as he doth aſſert that <hi>Synods rightly ordered and claſſes and conventions of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of particular Churches are all one,</hi> keyes. P. 42. So he doth call a <hi>Synod a Congregation of Churches, or a Church of Churches,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, there is a Presbyterian Claſſical Church, but <hi>of</hi> this and of Mat. 17. I ſhal ſpeak more hereafter.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Sect. 3. Reply, p. 2. <hi>Thirdly, why may not one Church be gathered of the members of many Churches, as wel as many Churches conſiſt of the members of one Church? For we read that the Church at</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>was ſcattered upon</hi> Stevens <hi>perſecution, and we read not that they returned again, but fell into memberſhip with other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (as is probable) which were planted in ſeverall parts of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rejoynder.</hi> Yes they may; in theſe troublous times, one family hath oft bin divided into more families; part of them at Mancheſter, another at home; and one family hath conſiſted of the members of many families, poſſibly the heads of ſeveral Country families have taken one houſe and dyeted together, yea it may be in times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, wives may live apart from their husbands, and their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands live together apart from their wives, yet it were ſtrang bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſay that the Apoſtles taught and practiſed the ſeperation of ſeveral husbands, and gathering them into a diſtinct family from their wives, and it is no leſs unreaſonable from the neceſſitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a ſcattered perſecuted Church, to infer that the Apoſtles taught and practiſed to ſeperate ſome Chriſtians &amp;c. Your ſelves do intimate P. 14. That one Church may meet in many places, in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114193:6"/>ſome time of hot perſecution, may we thence conclude that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles taught and practiſed the meeting of one Church in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? 2. You read as much of the return of the ſcattered diſciples to Jeruſalem, as you read of their falling into memberſhip with other Churches, if therefore it be probable (as you ſay it is) that they fell into memberſhip with other Churches, I am ſure it is as probable that they ere long did return to Jeruſalem, ſeing there was the firſt Church, the chief Church in which the Apoſtles continued as offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, whoſe doctrin and government all that were members of that Church could not but much deſire, and the perſecution was but ſhort though ſharp. Acts 9.31.3. Your ſelves do in effect acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that this argument doth not neceſſarily (if it do probably) conclude the undertaken concluſion. 4. They that fell into member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with other Churches did not (nor do you think they did) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Church of Jeruſalem, or refuſe communion with her or with the godly of her, aiming at a purer Church, and unleſs you had ſhewn this, you have not performed what you ſay you have performed. When the ſcattered Diſciples left the Church of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>it</hi> was their affliction, not their choice, much leſs was it their duty, as you pretend your ſeparation to be.</p>
               <p>Sect. 4 Reply, p. 2. <hi>Fourthly, ſuch a Church which conſiſts of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of many other true Churches, hath formerly bin without exception in the days of the Prelates; how comes it now to be queſtioned? For at leaſt fourteen years ſince, ſuch a Church was extant in</hi> Wirrall <hi>in</hi> Cheſhire, <hi>(the vocal covenant being only wanting) which conſiſted of the choiceſt Chriſtians of many pariſhes. And we think it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but Mr.</hi> Iohn Angiers <hi>Church at</hi> Denton <hi>in</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire, <hi>hath of long time been ſuch, and many other ſuch there have been beſides. And it was accounted an high happineſs to have liberty to make ſuch a Church; but was never accounted by the godly ſinful before. If aſſembling conſtantly together, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating in all the Ordinances that the reſt do partake of, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting with the reſt in the maintenance of the Miniſter of ſuch a place, and an adhering rather to ſuch a Miniſter and people, then to any other in affection and action, make members of a Church, then theſe perſons of other Pariſhes were members, and with the reſt made ſuch Churches.</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114193:7"/>inſtances (as you might)</item>
                     <item>2 I am informed, and in part know that theſe were not gathered ſeparated Churches, for thoſe members of other Churches did not refuſe communion in Pariſh-aſſemblies, they grieved when they were deprived of it for non-conformity; they did not exclude all that were not viſible Saints, much leſs the known godly of other Churches from their Sacraments, they aimed not prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally (it at all) at a purer Church but a better Miniſtry, they poſſibly having no Miniſtry at their pariſh Churches, or a bad one, and it may be dwelling neerer to thoſe, then to their own paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial aſſemblies, and you confeſs they wanted the <hi>vocal Covenant,</hi> and I ſuppoſe alſo they wanted <hi>ſubſcription,</hi> and <hi>ſignals,</hi> of their mutual conſent that they would be a Church together; and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted ſometimes to their pariſh meetings, and if they had had ſuch Miniſters there, and liberty of conſcience in point of geſture as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, it may be thought they would not have ſought elſe where.</item>
                     <item>3 Suppoſe there were ſuch a Church in the days of the Prelates, and that it was then lawful too; can you thence infer that it is ſtill lawful, though Innovations and ſcandalous Miniſters and other offenſive things be removed, have you as great occaſion ſtill of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing as they then had?</item>
                     <item>4 That ſuch a ſeparation was never accounted ſinful by the godly before is too large a ſpeech, if you mean, That the ſeparation which then was uſed by them that uſed it, and poſſibly by ſome others was approved, I contend not: but that no godly man accounted it ſinful, ordinarily to frequent another aſſembly (eſpecially if they had a Miniſter of ordinary parts and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) I cannot think. As for your ſeparation many godly did account it ſinful, yea the moſt eminent non-conformiſts, yea they which did beſt affect congregational government; yea you two have often told me and others of my godly brethren, That you are free in your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to baptize my child, or the children of any godly Miniſter, or member of our Church, or to receive us to the Sacrament amongſt you: now if you would act according to your own Principles, (which I ſhould conceive my ſelf bound in conſcience to do in this caſe) and would inform your Churches of their duty herein, your ſeparation would be leſs offenſive; but how you can account admiſſion of us to your Sacraments lawful and yet the denyal, of it not ſinful, I ſee not.</item>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> 1. What then? wil you thence conclude, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles taught or practiced to gather or ſeparate ſome Chriſtians from others &amp;c? Did your ſelves ever before call this <hi>gathering of Churches</hi> or <hi>ſeparating Chriſtians into Churches;</hi> is this the common acceptation of the words [Gathering of Churches] or ſeparating Chriſtians into Churches? Did your ſelves dream that was my meaning, or the thing I put you to prove? Doth remooval from one pariſh to another, imply the forſaking of, or ſeparating from the communion of the former pariſh, and refuſal to receive the Sacraments with the godly of the former pariſh? If not, how doth it, can it juſtifie your kind of ſeparation from all our pariſh-aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies? And yet you argue thus; remooval from one pariſh to another hath bin judged pious or at leaſt honeſt, therefore your ſeparation is pious and honeſt, and you ſhould conclude therefore the Apoſtles taught and practiſed your ſeparation.

Is it an abridgment of the children of your Church-members liberty to be accounted of your Church, or may they ſeparate themſelves from your communion, and gather whenſoever they conceive there is juſt occaſion into any Church which they think is purer? Sure you muſt ſay that they may; for ſeeing their parents voluntarily choſe your Church, why ſhould there now be an abridgment?</item>

I conceive the poor Sichemites had no thoughts of <hi>altering their Religion for a wife,</hi> nor would the men of the City (in all probability) have ſo unanimouſly conſented to it, they might look upon Circumciſion as a <hi>national rite,</hi> and by being <hi>one people</hi> they do interpret themſelves to mean of a <hi>civil union,</hi> viz. <hi>dwelling, trading, marrying one with another, enjoying the cattel and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one of another,</hi> Gen. 34.21.

               <p>You Reply p. 54. <hi>It was obedientiall, but principally for another reaſon, the ſervice of the Levites was the ſervice of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, which formerly the firſt borne performed, therefore Iſrael muſt lay hands on them, that is put that work upon them which was theirs, for as the laying on of hands on the ſacrifice did put the ſins on the ſacrifice: ſo the laying on of hands, did put the

You ſay, <hi>There were Deacons choſen, which had the overſight of the treaſure of this Church; for the Apoſtles gave themſelves to the miniſtery of the Word &amp; to Prayer,</hi> Act. 6.4. <hi>and neither medled with receiving, nor with diſpoſing of what was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114193:79"/>contributed: The Deacons took that burden from off them, ſo that now they received all, and diſpoſed of all: if any brought their eſtate, they laid it down at the Deacons feet; and if any diſtribution was made, the Deacons made it; the Apoſtles medled with nothing. So then the work was the ſame which the Deacons managed, with that which the Apoſtles had before managed, only it was in other hands, the Deacons came into the Apoſtles place: hence it follows, that if the</hi> diſtribution was made as every one had need, <hi>when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had the overſight, and if themſelves had a ſhare as their need required, and other Labourers with them; then it was ſo afterwards when the Deacons were intruſted in it; ſo then the Deacons office was to diſpoſe as the Labourers had need, and their office was not to overſee the Poor alone.</hi>

                     <item>2. The contrary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appears; for not only <hi>Paul</hi> took great care of the poor divers times and in divers places; and <hi>James, Cephas,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> (not the Deacons) did deſire him to remember the poor, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.10. but the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> Act. 11.30. ſent the relief for the poor bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which dwelt in <hi>Judaea,</hi> to the Elders, not to the Deacons. Now <hi>Agabus</hi> and other Prophets came lately thither from Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28. and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> that went with it, knew to whom to deliver it, yet they lay it down at the feet of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (not of the Deacons) which imports that <hi>Agabus,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> did know that the Apoſtles and Elders had ſomewhat to do with it, at leaſt to take for their own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity as they did before, and not to be at the diſpoſall of the Deacons; and if <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> had conceived it to be Gods ordinance that the Apoſtles and Elders ſhould not meddle with reception, they would have brought it to the Deacons whoſe office they knew well enough, nor would the Elders have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it at their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <item>4. By this doctrine, Paſtors, if they have meanes of their own, ought not to receive maintenance out of the Churches ſtock, except they have need in

You tell us, <hi>That the office of the Deacons is not temporary, but perpetuall.</hi> But what is this to prove Miniſters maintenance by Lords-day contributions, or out of the Church-ſtock? Yes, ſay you, <hi>In the Commandment which reſpects the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Miniſters,</hi> Gal. 6.6. <hi>the word is the ſame in the Greek which is in the commandment to diſtribute to the neceſſity of the Saints</hi> Rom. 12.13.

<list>
                     <item>1. The word <hi>communicating</hi> is a generall word, and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth all duties whereby men do mutually help one another,</hi> Calv. on Heb. 13.16.

                     <item>3.

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay further, <hi>That the word there uſed ſignifies often, Church-communion; and that the Apoſtles meaning may well be, that it ſhould be upon dayes when the Church meets in communion. Hence it is that Deacons are called</hi>

Cor. 12.28. <hi>which being interpreted, may import a perſon that receives ſomething for another, and it may beare receiving of a juſt reward for another, and ſo not for the poor Saints alone, but for the Labourers alſo.</hi> But what then? Is it your meaning, that every day the Church meets in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they are bound by the law of God to contribute to their Miniſters, whether they be Lords-dayes or no? 2. Is Church-communion any whit violated, if the Miniſter himſelf do receive
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114193:80"/>his own maintenance from others beſides the Deacon, and ſome other day beſides the Lords day? Your ſelves confeſſe, you would not be underſtood <hi>to exclude private diſtributing or communicating to the Miniſters or Members.</hi> 3. As for the word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114193:85"/>cannot make a different office. <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> (it may be) had a ſpeciall <hi>gift of terrifying ſinners,</hi> and are called <hi>ſonnes of thunder,</hi> Mark. 3 17. and <hi>Joſes</hi> a ſpeciall <hi>gift of comforting weak Saints,</hi> and called <hi>the ſon of conſolation,</hi> Act. 4.36. Yet no man will upon this ground conclude them to be different officers; one Paſtor may be excellent in one gift, another in another, poſſibly ſome men may be excellent in both gifts: <hi>Paraeus</hi> himſelf, a little after the place by you cited, ſaith, <hi>The Apoſtles did excell in both gifts, and they are indeed common parts of the Epiſcopal or Paſtoral office, and therefore are conjoyned,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.4. And it is evident,

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. WHen I ſay, that every particular Congregation is not Sion, but one of the <hi>Aſſemblies of Sion,</hi> Iſa. 4.5. That the <hi>Hebrewes which were divided into many Congregations, are not ſaid to be come to many mount Sions, but to mount Sion, Heb.</hi> 12. And that <hi>the Scripture warrants not the expreſſion of an hundred or a thouſand Sions.</hi> You reply, <hi>p.</hi> 71. That <hi>Sion was a mountain contiguous to</hi> Moriah <hi>upon which the Temple was built, in which God vouchſafed a ſpeciall preſence, and unto which the Tribes went up; and by a metonymy is frequently put for the temple, and the people that repaired thither and aſſembled there, and ſo for the Church of the Jewes, which conſiſted of many aſſemblies, and yet was but one Church, and the Temple was but one which was called Sion, and ſo Sion was but one. But in the times of the Goſpel there were to be no viſible temples where God would dwell, but the viſible Church,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16. <hi>and the viſible Church is Congregationall, not Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, much leſſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall, as hath been proved: therefore the Congregationall Church is Sion the ſpeciall place of Gods preſence.</hi>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. A queſtion of <hi>names and words</hi> is of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet in oppoſition to that which is moſt common with Congregational men, (yea with confeſſed Heretiques and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques) to call each of their Congregations by the name of <hi>Sion,</hi> which in their ſenſe imports that it is an entire viſible church, Independent of any Eccleſiaſtical judicature, and that the <hi>greateſt preſence of God is there to be found,</hi> and that combination of many Sions is unneceſſary, yea ſinfull; I truly obſerved, that there was but one Sion in the Old and New Teſtament, and that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture warrants not the expreſſion of an hundred or a thouſand Sions.</item>
                     <item>2. The Temple is one expreſſion, and Sion another: the Scripture may, yea doth acknowledge many <hi>temples</hi> of God, not many <hi>Sions;</hi> every Chriſtian is a <hi>temple,</hi> not a <hi>Sion;</hi> yet if you do betake your ſelves into the temple, I will follow you thither rnd fetch you thence.</item>
                     <item>3. The viſible Church in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. is not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114193:86"/>called a temple; but every Chriſtian <hi>in whom the ſpirit of God dwels,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.16. yea his <hi>body is the temple of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20. even that body which may <hi>be joyned to an harlot,</hi> which is eſpecially <hi>ſinned againſt and abuſed by fornication,</hi> viz. his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body (as Chriſt called his naturall body a temple, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19.) and that body which might be <hi>unequally yoked with unbelievers,</hi> 2 Cor 6.6. one way whereof was by <hi>unequall marriages,</hi> and of it the Apoſtle chiefly ſpeaks, and not of any viſible Church or Society as ſuch.</item>
                     <item>4. It hath been ſhewed that the viſible Church may not only be <hi>Congregationall,</hi> but <hi>Nationall,</hi> yea that there is an univerſall viſible Church. And in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. (which your ſelves interpret of the viſible Church) the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is not ſaid to be the <hi>whole city, houſe, or temple,</hi> but to be <hi>built to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> with other Churches and Chriſtians, and <hi>all the building groweth unto an holy temple</hi> in the Lord. Of this temple all the Churches to which <hi>Peter</hi> writes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. <hi>are living ſtones,</hi> not ſo many living temples, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. Thus <hi>many Nations ſhall</hi> in the day of the Goſpel <hi>be joyned to the Lord,</hi> and ſhall be <hi>Gods people,</hi> and he will <hi>dwell amongst them,</hi> Zach. 2.11. ſo Antichriſt is ſaid to ſit in the <hi>temple</hi> of God, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Church univerſall,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.2.4 See alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1. and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> (<hi>Keyes, p.</hi> 56.) ſaith, The new Jeruſalem is many particular churches combined, all which are yet but one city, one tabernacle, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.</item>

Reply, p. 71. <hi>Yet this hinders not but that the language of the Old Teſtament, when it ſpeaks of things of the New Teſtament, may be uſed in the Old Teſtament, yea in the New alſo, as in</hi> Zach. 14. 19. Iſa. 66.20, 21. <hi>So in</hi> Iſa. 4, 5. <hi>we may as well read of the aſſemblies of Sion, though there be no ſuch thing, but each aſſembly is Sion; as of the feaſt of tabernacles, when in the dayes of the Goſpel there is no ſuch thing, but it is ſpoken by way of alluſion; becauſe Sion was then but one, it is ſpoken of as one ſtill, and yet it is more then one.</hi>

                     <item>1. That the language of the Old Teſtament may be uſed in the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament or in the <hi>New,</hi> is not denied: yet it is conſiderable, if the word <hi>Sion</hi> be read perhaps two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times in the Scriptures, and never taken for one particular Independent congregation, as you frequently uſe it; if you could find <hi>Sions</hi> in the plurall number, you would judge it to be a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of your appropriating the word to a particular aſſembly,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114193:86"/>and full as good an argument for the Congregational way, as the terme <hi>[Churches]</hi> which you ſay (though untruly) is not found in the Jewiſh church.</item>
                     <item>2. If you can prove it to be as <hi>ceremoniall,</hi> that <hi>Sion</hi> ſhould conſiſt of <hi>many aſſemblies,</hi> as that the <hi>feaſt of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles</hi> ſhould be kept, and the one be as evidently <hi>abrogated</hi> as the other, then you ſay ſomething, or otherwiſe it is nothing. If a man ſhould endeavour to prove from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5. that the Church ſhould be at leaſt <hi>one aſſembly,</hi> you would not ſure ſtop his mouth with the <hi>feaſt of tabernacles.</hi> Now if I alledge that there ſhall be <hi>aſſemblies of Sion</hi> in the New Teſtament, I ſuppoſe you can find no ceremony in the plurality of the number.</item>
                     <item>3. That there is but <hi>one Sion,</hi> is the language, yea the conſtant unchanged language of the <hi>New</hi> as well as of the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, yea when it is applied to the Chriſtian church; and no example there is to the contrary; but the <hi>feaſt of tabernacles</hi> is not <hi>conſtantly,</hi> not <hi>frequently,</hi> not <hi>once</hi> (that I remember) applied to Chriſtian worſhip in the New-Teſtament; and therefore the caſe is not alike, though you make itſo.</item>

We know you hold,</hi> 1. <hi>That the Church of the Jewes was called Sion.</hi> 2. <hi>That the viſible Church in the dayes of the Goſpel is Sion; is it not manifeſt therefore that you hold, that look how many viſible Churches there are in the times of the Goſpel, ſo many Sions there are? You ſay the Hebrews which were divided into many Congregations, are ſaid to be come to one mount Sion? If ſo, then the Congregation of Chriſtian Gentiles may be called another mount Sion.</hi>

                     <item>1. All this doth not ſo much as prove (though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirms much more) that there is two <hi>Sions,</hi> one in the Old Teſtament, and another in the New. The Jewiſh church and the Chriſtian notwithſtanding may be but <hi>one Church, one Sion,</hi> though under a different ſtate and condition.</item>
                     <item>2. I hold not there are as <hi>many Sions</hi> as particular viſible Churches; but you groſſely miſunderſtand my words. A believing <hi>Jew</hi> and a believing <hi>Gentile</hi> may be (you will acknowledge) of one particular Congregation, and ſo of one Sion; much more may I ſay, that they both may come to one mount Sion, yea <hi>many people, all nations may flow unto it,</hi> Iſa. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But you aſſert that <hi>God is most preſent, vouchſafeth a ſpeciall preſence with his people gathered into a body, compacted together in an inſtituted Congregational Church,</hi> which you call <hi>the order of the Goſpel, the way of Chriſt;</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I demand,
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Have both of you, and your Members, ſince your entrance into the Church-way, felt ſuch a ſpeciall preſence of Chriſt in ordinances, as none of you did before?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. If your way be not the <hi>way of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>the order of the Goſpel,</hi> is not then the conceit of a greater and more ſpeciall preſence of Chriſt in your way, a ſtrong deluſion? As when men fall off from your Congregations to Antinomianiſme, Libertiniſme, Familiſme, or but rigid Separation, they perſwade themſelves (you know) that they haue a <hi>greater and more ſpeciall preſence of Chriſt</hi> after they have left you, then when they were with you. If I have ſolidly anſwered your Book (which I leave almighty God, and ingenious impartiall Saints to judge of) then your way is not the order of the Goſpel, nor the way of Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>That God might give his preſence, though there be ſome error,</hi> you grant, alledging <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14.20. and afterwards (you ſay) He vouchſafeth a ſpeciall preſence amongſt ſuch Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1.</item>

So then God not only <hi>might,</hi> but he <hi>doth</hi> give his preſence, yea his <hi>eſpeciall preſence</hi> to ſuch Churches as have not only <hi>ſome</hi> error, but <hi>groſſe</hi> error; for all the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were <hi>golden candleſticks,</hi>

But why do I put you upon this? you ſay they rule as Stewards and Captains, yea as <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Leaders,</hi> which Titles in Scripture Phraſe (in which I preſume you ſpeak) doe ſignifie the Power of civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates <hi>Act.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.2. and indeed <hi>Preſbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> in this ſenſe in oppoſition to Praelaticall and Popular Government you cannot deny, ſeeing the Scripture ſaith, <hi>they have the Rule,</hi> they <hi>feede and governe the flock.</hi> Heb. 13.7, 17.1 Tim. 5.17.1 Pet. 5.2. Acts 20.17, 28. The <hi>Keyes</hi> (which in the Notion of them doe carry <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authoritie</hi> properly ſo called) <hi>are committed to them</hi> Matth. 16.19. and <hi>Power to remit and retain ſins</hi> Joh. 20.28. <hi>and they are over the People in the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.12. and the Titles which are given to <hi>civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> (at leaſt to ſubordinate ones) are given to the <hi>Elders of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114193:92"/>the</hi> Church, and they (as you ſay afterwards) <hi>are Governours to the Church in the deſcending line of Power, though thy be but Miniſteriall Governours in an aſcending line that leads to Chriſt, the only Monarch or ſupreme Governour of the Church.</hi>

                     <item>2. The Apoſtles were not ſuch <hi>babes as to imagine that Chriſt would would lay down his ſpirituall Kingdome</hi> over the ſoules and conſciences of his People; but they are <hi>babes</hi> that imagine (as you intimate) that hee <hi>could not take up a temporall Kingdome, except hee did lay downe his ſpirituall</hi> Kingdome; for ſpirituall and civil Government which were confihenti in the perſon of <hi>Moſes, Eli, Samuel,</hi> were much more conſiſtent in the perſon of Chriſt, God and Man.</item>
                     <item>3. I ſaid not, that <hi>it will follow that Chriſt ſpake nothing by way of reproofe of ambitious aſpirings in the ſpirituall Kingdome of Chriſt;</hi> they may alſo bee included, though ambition in civill matters be the thing here <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>principally</hi>

                     <item>4. Nor denied I that inequality of men of the ſame office may be here forbidden, (ſave only that reaſon and order, if not Scripture, do require preſidencie, moderatorſhip) one Apoſtle is not to be above another Apoſtle, one Elder (as ſuch) above another Elder, &amp;c. Yet you cannot deny, that had Chriſts main ſcope been to forbid inequality of the Miniſters of the Word, an inſtance of the inequality of the <hi>Jewiſh and Gentiliſh Prieſts</hi> had been more pat then of the <hi>Gentile Princes.</hi>

                  <hi>Rejoynd.</hi> 1. You grant <hi>Diotrophes was an Elder of the Church of Corinth,</hi> and is it not probable he had a <hi>primacy</hi> of order, or ſome <hi>preheminence</hi> amongſt the Presbyters by reaſon of parts, or age, &amp;c? whereunto he was choſen by his brethren, and whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he made anſwer when <hi>John</hi> writ to the Church, as Preſidents, Moderators uſe to do when Colledges, Synods, Societies are writ unto; and if ſo, the word <hi>accepting</hi> is not an unmeet expreſſion. 2. That the text ſpeaks of an exorbitant <hi>preheminence uſurped over the whole,</hi> you aſſert, but prove not, the expreſſe words of the text are <hi>loving preheminence</hi> or <hi>primacy,</hi> not <hi>having preheminence</hi> (the word I uſed) not <hi>uſurping it</hi> (the word you uſe.) The <hi>prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> might be <hi>lawfull,</hi> and yet the love of it be blamed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as <hi>money, pleaſure, uppermoſt roomes, long clothing, ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:114193:95"/>may be lawfull, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.6. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.38. as your ſelves confeſſe: yea, the Prophet doth not reprove <hi>Princes</hi> for <hi>receiving of gifts</hi> or <hi>rewards,</hi> (notwithſtanding your inſtance to the contrary) but for corrupt inordinate loving or receiving of them. <hi>Saul</hi> did lawfully <hi>receive gifts,</hi> and they were <hi>men of Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that brought him none,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.27. though to <hi>love gifts</hi> or <hi>rewards,</hi> or to receive them ſo as to delay or pervert judgement, be a great ſinne, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.23. 3. By what logick do you conclude <hi>Diotrophes is not here blamed,</hi> ergo he is <hi>excuſed from the guilt of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary excommunication,</hi> in regard of the materiality of the action, or <hi>he is not here blamed,</hi> therefore he <hi>is not to blame,</hi> &amp;c.

The main hypotheſis whereof is unſound; for it is neceſſary that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing church in the time of the Goſpel ſhould be conformed to ſpirituall precepts and patterns left us by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and Chriſt hath not appointed the Jewiſh church to be a pattern to Goſpel church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; ſo then Churches of Preſbyterian complexion are not here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, for there is a vaſt difference between them and the Jewiſh church.</hi>

You ſhew a vaſt difference between our Churches and the Jewiſh; but doth this prove that the ſubordination of Eccleſiaſtical judicatories amongſt the Jews was ceremoniall, or that we may not reaſon for it from the analogie of the Jewiſh church? Anabaptiſts may and do render many differences between Judaiſme and Chriſtianity, Baptiſme and Circumciſion: and yet notwithſtanding from them all we may conclude from analogie the lawfulneſſe of Paedobaptiſme, and Chriſtian Magiſtracie. There is a vaſt difference between the Prieſts of the Law and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel; yet the Apoſtle by analogie reaſons from the one to the other in point of maintenance.

                     <item>1. The texts cited prove that Chriſt is a King, a Prieſt and Prophet, but not that Congregational churches do only ſo take him.</item>
                     <item>2. You inſinuate that it may be found in the writings of ſome on your right hand, you may mean the rigid Seperatiſts which if it bee, I am ſure it is found in the writings of thoſe that in point of government are Congregational men and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and neither Presbyterians nor Prelatiſts, but ſome of them members of your Churches.</item>
                     <item>3.

               <p>
                  <hi>Rejoind.</hi> Yes, in generall termes, but they are not ſpoken to the Church as the proper ſubject or party to act in, or manage government, which was the ſenſe I ſpake in, nor do they tend to inveſt any but Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with Church-power, only they make the Church the object about which, and for the good whereof that power is to bee uſed, whom the Apoſtle would ſtir up to a good eſteem and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable enjoyment of the miniſteriall power, but not to aſſume or challenge it to, or execute it by Non-elders.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114193:112"/>concerns none by way of obligation but only</hi> Timothy, <hi>you beat upon a harſh ſtring; for muſt none flee theſe things, fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, (by vertue of this Text) but only</hi> Timothy? <hi>or if to his ſucceſſors, then it muſt be the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Elders, not the Church, you mend non the matter, muſt El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders only, and not beleevers follow after godlineſſe, righteouſneſſe, faith, &amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rejoynd.</hi> 1. I might without any harſhneſſe or abſurdity argue that the commandement preceding concerns none by way of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation but only <hi>Timothy himſelfe,</hi> or if any elſe, his ſucceſſors <hi>the ordinary Elders,</hi> and that none are to performe the duties of <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. in the ſenſe here uſed by vertue of this Text but hee or they; for what harſhneſſe and abſurdity cannot it bee to ſay that Biſhops only are to bee blameleſſe, to have but one wife, to bee vigilant, ſober, &amp;c. by vertue of <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4. or that Deacons only muſt bee grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, &amp;c. by vertue of <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. and that their wives ſhould bee grave, <hi>v.</hi> 13. though other men beſides Biſhops are to be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the husband of one wife, &amp;c. for that which is ſpoken in Scripture to, or of one particular perſon is ſometimes appliable to others. 1. When the <hi>ſubiect matter is of common concernment,</hi> and a generall duty, as <hi>Mark</hi> 13.37. or ſecondly, when there is a <hi>parity of perſons,</hi> as what is commanded to one as a <hi>father, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, Miniſter, &amp;c.</hi> is obliging to other <hi>Fathers, Magiſtrates, &amp;c.</hi> in this ſenſe <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> ſo farre as they are called to the ſame publick charge that <hi>Timothy</hi> was, are by vertue of this text <hi>to follow righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> but other Chriſtians are obliged to the ſame things no further then they are of <hi>common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and required of them by <hi>other texts</hi> of Scripture. 2. That it may appeare that the Apoſtle is here dealing with <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> as <hi>an Evangeliſt</hi> or <hi>Elder</hi> of the Church it is eaſily obſervable. 1. That ſome things are in this Epiſtle directed by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> for him to <hi>convey over, communicate,</hi> and procure to be <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved</hi> by others under his charge, ſuch are thoſe in <hi>cap.</hi> 2.1, 8, 9. &amp;c. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.2, 3. &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 8. &amp;c. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.4, 5, 8. &amp;c. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.1, 2, 17. in his lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down theſe things, the <hi>parties</hi> whom the duties concern are particularly nominated to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and hee is willed to put <hi>them in remembrance of theſe things</hi> to <hi>command, teach, and give them-in charge, cap.</hi> 4.6, 11. and <hi>cap.</hi> 5.7. and 6 2, 17. 2. That other
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114193:113"/>things are directed to him for <hi>himſelfe to execute</hi> and obſerve in his own perſon, hee bearing a particular office different from, and ſuperior to all others in that <hi>Church of Epheſus,</hi> and that which had for its object all the officers and members in that Church with the duties of them all, and this appears to bee the <hi>principall part,</hi> and his Inſtruction in this the principal end, of this Epiſtle, <hi>cap.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.2, 3 4. Of theſe things, ſome are ſo <hi>perſonall</hi> that they cannot be applyed to any in that <hi>Church</hi> but <hi>himſelfe,</hi> as <hi>cap.</hi> 1.2, 18. and <hi>cap.</hi> 4.14. and <hi>cap.</hi> 5.23. Others are for his <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and excitation</hi> to the diſcharge of his office, as <hi>cap.</hi> 1.19.4.6, 7, 11, 12, <hi>ad finem, cap.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3, 7, 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 7, 20. and although many of theſe for the <hi>matter of them</hi> and in <hi>part</hi> are the duty of <hi>others</hi> and particularly of <hi>Elders,</hi> yet in a ſort they are <hi>perſonall,</hi> and in their <hi>formall</hi> and full conſideration can be only <hi>obliging</hi> to <hi>Timothy:</hi> which may bee 'yet more evident. 1. By the ſingular <hi>compellations</hi> and <hi>perſonall addreſſes</hi> to him in them, as <hi>Thou, thou my ſonne, ſonne</hi> Timothy, <hi>thou O man of God, O</hi> Timothy. 2. The limiting circumſtances of time and place, c. 1.3. c. 4.13. 3. The nature of the <hi>office</hi> he was here ſet to <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,</hi> viz. that of an Evangeliſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. 1 Cor. 16.10. by vertue of which he had a <hi>peculiar way</hi> of performing the ſaid duties, not <hi>competible</hi> to others, &amp; of which none of the reſt were capable of, and therefore they could not be obliged to the acts and rules of it as he was for <hi>whoſe direction this Epiſtle was written,</hi> c. 3.13, 14. 4. The deep and <hi>reiterated charges given him</hi> by name about theſe things, <hi>without any partners</hi> adjoyned to him, <hi>c.</hi> 1.18. &amp; 5.21. &amp; 6.13, 14, 20. which to thoſe which then were not in being, could not <hi>formally</hi> be delivered, nor could they <hi>with any congruity</hi> be taken hold of by, or <hi>preſſed upon</hi> others <hi>then</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus.</hi> 5. Had theſe things as well as others concerned all, or any beſides, he would in all likelihood have <hi>ordered him to have publiſhed the whole</hi> to all, as he doth in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.16. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.27. and not have directed him to impart <hi>ſome things</hi> in particular as he doth, <hi>c.</hi> 1.3. &amp; 4.6.11. &amp; 5.7. &amp; 6.2.17.18.19. What I have ſaid of all that in this Epiſtle is ſpoken to <hi>Timothy</hi> by name as his duty, and of peculiar obligation to him, may be applied to the Text in hand, and there are yet in it ſome things more which may be noted as <hi>characters of appropriation</hi> to him as an <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> or <hi>Miniſter,</hi> viz.

If you grant that a <hi>Paſtor</hi> may adminiſter the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> to <hi>another Church</hi> comming into his <hi>aſſembly,</hi> as you ſay you do, then firſt, May not a <hi>Paſtor</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> upon ſome occaſion go to the <hi>meeting-place</hi> of another Church, and there perform the ſame miniſteriall acts by conſent of all parties inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed, as he may do if that <hi>other Church come to his Churches meeting-place?</hi> Doth the place make any difference in your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114193:129"/>Secondly, May a Paſtor (if his flock be preſent) <hi>admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacrament</hi> to <hi>another Church</hi> (which poſſibly may be an hundred times bigger then his own) and may he not, if his flock be abſent? doth the preſence of his church add ſo much to his power over another church? Sure theſe things are <hi>gratis dicta,</hi> without Scripture, without reaſon.</item>
                     <item>2. As for <hi>recommendation,</hi> I anſwer firſt, M. <hi>Cotton</hi> &amp; the Elders of <hi>N.E.</hi> (as I ſhewed before) yield another way of <hi>communicating</hi> betwixt Churches beſides <hi>Recommendation,</hi> ſo that this barre is <hi>needleſſe</hi> and <hi>untrue,</hi> if <hi>they</hi> muſt be Judges. Secondly, if <hi>Recommendation</hi> be ſo needfull for a <hi>whole Churches</hi> communicating with another Church, it may be had from its offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers &amp; from other neighbour-churches, or from members of that church to which they come and joyn, which are able to <hi>teſtifie of them.</hi> Thirdly, whereas you ſuppoſe they may <hi>commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> this is of all other reliefs the weakeſt as good <hi>as nothing,</hi> a <hi>meer formality;</hi> ſure <hi>Recommendation</hi> with you is very <hi>needfull</hi> that muſt be thus patched up, rather then wanted; when it is thus helpt out, it ſtands you in great ſtead.</item>
                     <item>3. As for <hi>comming of one Church to another,</hi> I rejoyn, firſt, If they communicate with this other church by vertue of <hi>communion of churches,</hi> they muſt needs be conſidered as a <hi>diſtinct church; Communion</hi> is (at leaſt) between <hi>two,</hi> and imports <hi>plurality</hi> and <hi>diſtinction</hi> betwixt the parties; <hi>Identity</hi> deſtroyes <hi>communion,</hi> which conſiſts in the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie</hi> or <hi>agreement</hi> of perſons or things in <hi>aliquo tertio,</hi> and not in a <hi>coaleſcencie</hi> of them in <hi>one.</hi> Secondly, whatſoever they are counted, howſoever conſidered by you, this <hi>temporary fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> makes them not indeed <hi>one church</hi> with that they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with. Your way of <hi>conſtituting churches,</hi> and your <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant;</hi> [Cottons <hi>Way, p.</hi> 104.] wild noc brook ſuch an <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>interchangeable</hi> putting together into <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>parting again</hi> of churches: your <hi>conſidering them as one,</hi> then, when they <hi>are not</hi> ſuch, is the <hi>error</hi> of your <hi>Conceptus,</hi> and ſalves not the matter in hand; in this caſe deny it if you can: A <hi>Miniſter acts miniſterially to another church,</hi> and now you have brought <hi>two churches together in communion,</hi> let me enquire, May not <hi>their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders act in common to both?</hi> are the <hi>Eldert of either</hi> ſuſpended in this conjunction? and if ſo, <hi>of which</hi> are they that are to be <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended?</hi> and why not a <hi>third, and a fourth church come to them after the ſame manner,</hi> and the Elders of all joyn intereſts in ruling, what will lack to make up here a <hi>Claſſis or Preſbyterie of many
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114193:129"/>churches?</hi> Thus you are unawares comming into <hi>our tents.</hi> Thirdly by this you plainly teach, a <hi>Miniſter acts</hi> not <hi>miniſterially</hi> but in the <hi>preſence of his Congregation;</hi> and the <hi>authoritativeneſſe</hi> of his acting, and <hi>lawfulneſſe of his authoritative acts</hi> depends on their being aſſembled with him. But, firſt, it is the <hi>preſence of Chriſt</hi> which gives <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> to his <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> Mat. 18.20. which is promiſed to him <hi>alway,</hi> and with no ſuch <hi>limitation,</hi> Mat. 28.20. Secondly, ſome <hi>Miniſteriall acts</hi> are required of him in <hi>private,</hi> Jam. 5.14. 2 Tim. 2.15. 1 Tim. 4.13, 14, 15, 16. He is to <hi>charge privately</hi> the people, <hi>that they live not inordinately;</hi> Cottons keyes, <hi>p.</hi> 21, 22. and he may act authoritatively in a <hi>Synod of churches,</hi> where his Church is not collectively (which is your ſenſe) preſent.
